// Answers to questions 9(a) through 9(g) from GitAssignment

9. Answer the following questions in the answers.txt file, and then push the changed file to the repository:

(a)	How many commits have been done to the repository by the end of step 8?

	Not counting the six commits that have been added to the repository
	prior to my fork, I have committed three times since forking the project.
	Total, between the two repositories, there have been nine commits by
	this point.

(b) When was the file .gitignore modified last?

	From the information available to me, the .gitignore file was last modified at 10:29AM EDT on Thursday, September, 15, 2016.

(c) How many times was each of the files inside the src folder modified?

	./src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/RoleGame.java			1 (Not modified after creation)
	./src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/BasicWeapon.java		1 (Not modified after creation)
	./src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/Sword.java				2 (Modified once after creation)
	./src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/Weapon.java			1 (Not modified after creation)
	./src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/WeaponFactory.java		1 (Not modified after creation)

(d) What is the difference between git log and git status?

	git log displays the full log of all commit messages in the repository since the initial commit, with author, timestamp, and commit ID hash.

	git status shows the current status of the working directory of the local repository, including if there exist any files that have yet to be staged for a commit, how many commits the current branch is ahead or behind of the origin source, and what branch the user is currently working on.

(e) What command would you use to see the commits where "RoleGame.java" was one of the committed files?

	Given a path to "RoleGame.java" as <path>, the command would be:
		git log -- <path>\RoleGame.java

	In this assignment structure, the full path to RoleGame.java and the command to see all commits modifying the file is
		git log -- src\edu\fsu\cs\cen5035\RoleGame.java

(f) What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word "file?"

	git log --grep=file

(g) What command would you use to see the commits made by "Alice" between 09/01/2016 and 09/16/2016?

	git log --committer=alice --after=08/31/2016 --until==09/16/2016
